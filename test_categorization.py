        SAFETY STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
        
        Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Requirements
        
        All employees must wear the following PPE when entering the production area:
        - Safety goggles or face shields when working with chemicals
        - Steel-toed boots at all times in the facility
        - Cut-resistant gloves when handling sharp objects
        - Hard hats in designated areas with overhead hazards
        
        Chemical Handling Safety:
        1. Always read the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) before handling any chemical
        2. Ensure proper ventilation when working with volatile substances
        3. Never mix chemicals unless specifically instructed
        4. Store chemicals in proper containers with clear labeling
        
        Hazard Communication:
        - Report any unsafe conditions immediately to your supervisor
        - Know the location of all emergency exits
        - Understand the meaning of all safety signs and symbols
